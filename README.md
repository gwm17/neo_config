# neo_config

My neovim config, which I'm trying out as a daily driver. Uses lazy as the package manager.
Inspiration taken from [kickstarter.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) and
ThePrimagen's [tutorial](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/init.lua).

## Requirements

Requires [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) and [neovim](https://neovim.io) (duh)
